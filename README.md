# Deeplearning-LSTM
This code develops a Long-Short Term memory model which is a type of recurrent neural network that is capable of understanding intricate data patterns and help in predictions.
The code initially loads the dataset 
Following which the dataset is normalised.
The model contains 3 layers of 128 , 64 and 32 neurons/units in each layer respectively
